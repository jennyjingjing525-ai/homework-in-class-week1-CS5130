1.How did visualization enhances understanding of linear algebra concepts (or maybe they didn't)?
I think visualization hep me understand lianear algebra cocepts clearly. I can imagine their sites in space and how to connect them or move them in space.

2.How do you think Linear Algebra might connect to Artificial Intelligence?
From my perspective, Linear Algebra is very important to AI. It helps to deal with a lot of data in vectors. Someone told me the core function idea of Page ranking of Google is coming from Linear Algebra. I want to dive it to learn more.

3.Do you feel better prepared for the math in this class going forward? Or if you already knew something about the topic, was this a good refresher?
I think it is good for me. But the most important thing for me is to get familiar with the English words.

4.What did you like/dislike about the plotting tools?
I want to try more plotting tools in order to make it clear and look beautiful. I like visualization results are user-freindly, so I need to do more practice.

5.Did you feel like the homework problems were a good use of your time? If you could change this assignment for future students, what might you want to see happen?
Yes, I think it is a good use of my time. I suggest give some assigments for students to do practice by themselves, which are not included in the score.
